# LJ Code 201 - Day 19


Today we worked as a group fixing and troubleshooting our app. We actually did some white boarding to make sure our ideas fall in place when we wrote them out. We did pair programing when resolving our bugs and since I did not work on Java Script side so i would get exposure to our functionality.

Over all it was a fun project for us to work on everyone knew what they were doing. I will miss my team.
