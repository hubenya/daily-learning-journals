# LJ Code 201 - Day 6


Today we were covered how to create user input fields and using DOM to generated information from user input can be save on the same page after user click on submit.

It was nice to see event listeners produce and change results on the spot. I can relate a some of these things to my previous projects when I was testing them. Its kinds nice to be on the other side of the table.

Looking forward to add this to my salmon and cookies project when I get there.
