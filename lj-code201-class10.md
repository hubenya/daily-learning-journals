# LJ Code 201 - Day 10


Today we were covered how to modify page layout using CSS. Also how we can make live tweaks to the page using dev tools. i've used them in the past but mostly for testing.

I'm happy I was able to add event listeners to my page and render new data. Also made good progress on the HTML and Nav styling of my page Chocolate pizza.
