# LJ Code 201 - Day 11


Today we were covered java script functionality oh how to handle random image to display on the page and when user clicks on the image they would be presented with another set of images that they have to select. This would repeat till they would have completed a set of 25.

Today for me was worse than last week. It was hard to see the big picture and the ability to put it all together. I barely made it through last week not sure how this one will be. Tring to stay positive but not sure if I can survive
