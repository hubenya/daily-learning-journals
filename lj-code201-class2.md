# LJ Code 201 - Day 2


Today I learned how to create branches and ACP your changes to the branch I was working on.
I liked that we went through it few times to get the concept down.

When we got to our lab, it seemed like everyone was struggling with for and while loops. I had to redo my few time after class example did not work for me and will continue to work on it after I do this journal and my quiz. This is defiantly something I need to read and watch some tutorials about.
