# LJ Code 201 - Day 6


Today we were covered Domain Modeling(DOM), and also had introduction to Objects. I understood the basic knowledge and syntax of obj but the lad assignment was complex and I had hard time putting the who loop and function together.

Overall we tried to help each other and move along with the assignment. It was hard to putt the whole logic together. I will be working on it further and see how much I can get done today.
