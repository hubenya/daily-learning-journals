# LJ Code 201 - Day 18


yesterday and today we worked on our group project, my main responsibility was to make the div boxes to cover every state on the map. It was a lot of copy and paste but mostly had to paly around with moving boxes on the page which took a lot of time. I'm exited to see our final product live and people use it.

  It was a good way for us to practice and divide our work this made our job and collaboration really easy. There as some aspects of the game that we planed really well and that also played good role on our end result.
