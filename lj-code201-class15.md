# LJ Code 201 - Day 15


Today we were reviewed what we covered past three weeks. It was nice to see what I was able to remember about those topics. The most important part is that we got to start working on our group projects. We had one design yesterday and we made few more changes to our initial design. We got our scaffolding done for the most part today. Had to lay out our flow for our guessing game. I hope we can achieve our design goal and make our awesome app.

Looking forward to next week to see what we will be able to build in the time that we have. exited for our group.
