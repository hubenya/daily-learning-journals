# LJ Code 201 - Day 20


Today we worked on practicing our presentation of our small game project. I was happy that we got most of the functionality done and our app was fun to play. most of us knew what we worked on. I was thinking it would be easier to make some pieces of the app work better but with our limited knowledge of the development world it was not an easy part.

Its fun to look back and see what we were able to accomplish in one week.
