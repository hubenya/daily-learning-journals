# LJ Code 201 - Day 13

Today we were covered how to make your browser remember your last status if you remain in the same tab and using local storage to store some data about user or user input. I used local storage to test API responses and when your local machine acts as server there are some layers where I was able to see details about the calls.

Today I did not get to implement my local storage to bus mall project and I feel like this was one of the hardest lectures to understand. I think it was because this was a subject which I thought I knew more then I learned.
