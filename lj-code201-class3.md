# LJ Code 201 - Day 3


Today we were practicing how to work with functions and I was struggling with function 3 but after few students explained I understood the logic but it was still hard for me to make it work.

I will be working with my pair programmer tomorrow and try to see if I can figure it out. I was thinking this would be an easy exercise so I could work to add things to my about me page.
