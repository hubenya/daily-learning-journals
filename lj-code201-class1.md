# LJ Code 201 - Day 1

Today a more about css, javascript and html and how they work together.
There is a lot of information to absorb but the awesome thing is that we get to practice it in the lab. Lab is an awesome setting to work in the group to figure things out and work of each other. I wish I was born with 6 sense and knew how to code with my diaper on but that did not happen and not I have to learn it on my own.
